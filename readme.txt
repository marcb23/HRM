Notes 12/6

-began to document circuit with LT spice, no part for sensor found
-circuit has heartbeat-like false response when Arduino is connected b/t output and R to ground
-maybe more accurate reading across voltage divider from output to ground
-way to test functionality of sensors? (i.e. voltage may have burnt it out)

-First for next time: find ways to test sensor and filtering circuit separately
